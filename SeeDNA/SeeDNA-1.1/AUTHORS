The SeeDNA program was written by SHEN Junjie, Computer Science,
Zhejiang University, in 2003/2004 using the GTK+ graphic package
for Linux systems at the suggestion of HAO Bailin.

SeeDNA is an essential improvement and extension of an early program
called seeDNA written by Hong-yi Cheng (Maggie), Bailin HAO and Shuyu
ZHANG in 1997/1998 for UNIX Workstations using the Xlib, XToolkit and
Ethena Package included in the X11 Release 6 (X11R6) of MIT. The source
code of the old seeDNA is still available at request to HAO Bailin at
mailto: hao@itp.ac.cn

The algorithm of drawing a 2-dimensional histogram to visualize the
K-string composition was described in:

B. -L. Hao, H. C. Lee, S.-Y. Zhang, "Fractals related to long DNA
sequences and bacterial complete genomes", Chaos, Solitons and
Fractals 11 (2000) 825-836.

The nature of regular patterns seen in many "portraits" of bacteria
was analyzed in a series of papers by HAO Bailin, Xie Huimin,
YU Zuguo, and CHEN Guoyi and reviewed in:

Bailin Hao, "Fractals from genomes: exact solutions of a biology-inspired
           problem", Physica A282 (2000) 225-246.

The 1-dimensional histograms were described in:

Bailin Hao, "`Spatial-temporal' patterns in prokaryote genomes", Int. J.
Bifurcation and Chaos, 12 (2002) 2625-2630.

The unexpected fine structures in the 1D histograms of some randomized
bacterial genomes with biased G + C content was discovered and explained in:

Huimin Xie, Bailin Hao, "Visualization of K-tuple distribution in
prokaryote complete genomes and their randomized counterparts", in
Computer Systems Bioinformatics Conference CSB2002 Proceedings,i
IEEE Computer Society, Los Alamitos, California, pp. 31-42.
