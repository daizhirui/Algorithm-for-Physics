Installation Instructions for SeeDNA ver.1.0
============================================

SeeDNA is a program to visualize the K-string composition of long DNA sequences
including complete chromosomes or genomes. It is written in C using the GTK+
graphic package for LINUX systems.

Before installing SeeDNA one should ensure that the GTK+ package (Version
2.0 or higher) has already been installed. If not, download it from
http://www.gtk.org
and follow the instructions therein.

To install and run SeeDNA in a Red Hat 9 environment follow the steps below:

1. Download the SeeDNA package from
   http://www.itp.ac.cn/~hao/SeeDNA-1.0.tar.gz

2. Enter the directory where SeeDNA-1.0.tar.gz resides.

3. Unzip the above file by issuing command:
   gunzip SeeDNA-1.0.tar.gz
   or equivalently:
   gzip -d SeeDNA-1.0.tar.gz

4. Untar the unzipped file by issuing command:
   tar xvf SeeDNA-1.0.tar
   A subdirectory SeeDNA-1.0 will be created.

5. Change to the directory by issuing command:
   cd SeeDNA-1.0
   and then configure the pac kage to the system by typing command: 
   ./configure'
   If 'csh' shell is being used on an old version of System V, one might
   need to type
   sh ./configure
   instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute 'configure' itself.

   Running 'configure' takes a while.  While running, it prints some
   messages telling which features it is checking for.

6. Type `make' to compile the package.

7. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
   documentation
   
8. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
   source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
   files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
   a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
   also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
   for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
   all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
   with the distribution.

9. After finishing the steps above, one can now run it by typing
   SeeDNA &
   Or if you did not 'make install', you can run it in the sub directory 
   'src' by typing
   ./SeeDNA &

   While SeeDNA is running follow the menus in the self-explanatory
graphic user interface. One must first open one or more DNA sequence files by
pressing 'Ctrl - O' or choosing menu item 'File' then 'Open'. The file format
supported by SeeDNA is GenBank and FASTA, if the format is not correctt,
SeeDNA will issue an alert.

   After the files have been opened, choose one in the displayed list.
Before you draw a two-dimensional (portrait) or a one-dimensional histogram,
one can adjust some parameters in Settings and/or Advanced Settings.

   To learn more what a portrait or histogram means please read the information
in AUTHORS and papers cited therein.

   Enjoy seeing K-string distribution in DNA.
